            There are very many musical instruments in the music industry.
            They can be classified with regard to various factors such how they are played.
            Primarily, there are three types of musical instruments:

            These types of musical instruments are played through blowing the air into the air column in the tube.
            When air is blown, a sound is produced however the pitch of the sound produced will always depend on the length of the tube.
            Shorter air columns will always produce a higher pitch as compared to the shorter air column which produces.

                Examples of different types of musical instruments in this category include the flute, the English horn, the oboe, the pianica, the Bagpipe etc.

        <p>These types of instruments can further be classified as</p>

                Woodwinds are instruments such as bassoons and oboes.
                They are played by blowing air into a reed, which is attached by a wind pipe to the instrument, which has valves situated along its length to regulate the flow of air. Woodwinds are constructed of wood, which gives them a distinct sound.

                Brass instruments take their name from the material most often used to make them.
                Trumpets and saxophones are common examples of brass instruments.
                Sometimes brass and woodwinds are classified together as wind instruments; however, the playing technique is different.
                While both woodwinds and brass are played by blowing air into the instrument, brass instruments do not use reeds, although saxophones may have shaped mouthpieces attached to the end of the instrument.

            These types of musical instruments depend entirely on string vibration to produce sound.
            The sound produced depends on both the length of the string and the thickness of the string.
            Some common examples of string instruments include the guitar, the sitar, the harp, the sarod, the santor, the mandolin, the double bass etc.
            These types of musical instruments can further be classified in three distinct classes.
            These include the lutes, the harps and the zithers.
            This classification is based on how the string is placed on the musical instrument.
        </p>

        <p>A guitar is a good example of lutes string instruments.
            The harps have string placed within the frame while in the zithers have the string placed on the instrumentâ€™s body.
            The playing mechanisms include plucking for the case of a guitar, blowing for the case of violin and striking.
            String instruments, just like the percussion instruments are widely used in music industry.

                Strings are instruments such as violin, guitar, harp and bass.
                They are played either by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, which is the case for guitars and harps, or by gliding a bow across the strings, for violins and cellos.
                In the case of a stand-up (or acoustic bass), all three methods may be used to play the instrument.

            There are the widely used types of musical instruments.
            Examples of musical instruments in this category include the drum.
            Other examples are the xylophone, the table, the bells, the cymbals, the marimba, the nagara etc.
            In these types of musical instruments, sound is produced by either striking or beating the instrument surface which generate vibrations of the desired sound note.
            They are further classified as pitched or unpitched percussion.
            The note produced by the pitched instruments can be identified while the notes produced by the unpitched cannot be identified.
            The sound produced will depends on how the surface of the instrument is struck and the exact points struck.

        <p>
            The most commonly known form of percussion instruments are drums.
            However, triangles and cymbals are also considered to be percussion instruments.
            Percussion instruments are struck with drumsticks or the flat palm of the hand to produce sound.
            Cymbals are struck against one another to produce sound, or they can be struck with a drumstick, or brushed with a percussion brush.
